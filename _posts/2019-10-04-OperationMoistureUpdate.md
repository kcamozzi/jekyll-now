title: Update - Operation Moisture
---

So it's been about 2 months since my first report on operation moisture. During that time a lot has happened to my little sproutlings. I'll try to summarize:
  * Updated moisture sensor (Digital vs Analog)
  * Created a few time lapses of early growth
  * Created twitter bot to tweet daily growth updates and statistics
  * Sensor destroyed by squirrels
  * Plants nearly destroyed by squirrels twice
  * Created a motion triggered servo motor to scare away rodents (Successful)
  * Blossoms!
  
I'll start with my sensor issues. While I was successful in detecting motisture with the original sensor, I soon realized that an analog reading was not going to help me much. By the time the reading would be false, the flowers would be suffering too much from lack of water. The soil had to be bone dry before I would get a 0 reading from my sensor. I updated my sensor to one that would be able to give me a digital reading of the moisture in the water.
