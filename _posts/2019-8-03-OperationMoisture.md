title: Operation Moisture
---

As a freshly graduted computer science student, I needed to find a project to keep myself occupied during my ongoing job hunt. I have recently taken an interest in automated gardening. Personally, I have no experience in gardening or growing plants in any capacity. My goal is to apply my skillset of electronics and technologies in order to build a sort of automated environment.

Currently, my starting foundation is going to be very minimal. I have a tendancy to want to bite off more than I can chew at the beginning of projects so I decided to start small. Day 1 of my project consisted of the following:

* Setting up a linux environment on a raspberry pi zero w (Raspian)
* Wiring a DHT111 humidity/temperature sensor with additional moisture sensor
* Obtaining a basic planter box and flower seeds
